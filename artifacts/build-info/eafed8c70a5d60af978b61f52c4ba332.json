randomness\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev PURPOSE\\n *\\n * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness\\n * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not\\n * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key\\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\\n *\\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\\n * @dev from the output space.\\n *\\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\\n * @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\\n * @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev USAGE\\n *\\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\\n * @dev shown:\\n *\\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\\n * @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\\n * @dev       }\\n * @dev   }\\n *\\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\\n * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\\n * @dev subscription management functions).\\n * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\\n * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\\n * @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\\n *\\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\\n *\\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\\n * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\\n *\\n * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\\n * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\\n * @dev with which randomness request.\\n * @dev See \\\"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\\\" for principles to keep in mind,\\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\\n *\\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\\n * @dev differ.\\n *\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\\n *\\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\\n *\\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\\n */\\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\\n   */\\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
